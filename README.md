17. In a generator for use with an industrial engine, said generator having a driven member secured to a driving member of said engine, said driving and driven members comprising a drive train, the improvement comprising a plastic multi-part sectoral annular fan for attachment to the drive train, each fan part having an interlocking member at each side thereof, said interlocking members of adjacent fan parts having means to interlock so as to join the fan parts together without their attachment to the drive train, and means for extending through said interlocking members to secure them together and to the drive train.

As can be seen in the figure, cooling fans 100 are fixedly secured to front and rear end faces, respectively, of the magnetic core assembly 6. Thus, when the magnetic core assembly 6 rotates together with the shaft 1, the cooling fans 100 are caused to rotate as an integral unit with the magnetic core assembly 6, whereby the ambient air is taken in through an intake port 7 under the air-drawing action of the rotating fans 100 and caused to flow circulatively through the interior of the AC generator while cooling heat generating portions thereof to be finally discharged through a discharge port 9.

20. In a generator for use with an industrial engine, said generator having a driven member, said engine having a driving member, and a generally flexible connection between said driven and driving members, the improvement comprising a molded plastic multi-part annular fan for attachment to the driving member and flexible connection, each fan part having an interlocking member at each side thereof, one of said interlocking members for each fan part having a cylindrical sleeve molded therein and the other of said interlocking members having means defining a hole therein for receiving the cylindrical sleeve of the adjacent fan part as the fan parts are joined, and means for extending through said cylindrical sleeves to attach said fan parts together and to said driving member.

1 and 2, the multi-piece fan 20 of the present invention is comprises four segments 22, each segment 22 being a one-piece molded member having an arcuate base member 24 and a plurality of upstanding fan blades 26. The fan blades 26 have a generally arcuate shape themselves to scoop the air and propel it through the windings of the generator, as is known in the art.
